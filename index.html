				<h3>We Make getting from A to B fun.</h3>
				<p>So how does this actually work? Put an engineer, an architect, and two 
                    computer programmers who also happen to all ride bikes together and have a passion for community greatness. The computery brains behind Rickshaw Photobooth is a Raspberry Pi micro computer. 
                    Upon request, this computer will capture, process and output a series of images. Photos are instantly processed and uploaded to an online gallery and shared over social media. 
                    At the end of the ride users have the option to scan a QR code to download images to their mobile phones.</p>
